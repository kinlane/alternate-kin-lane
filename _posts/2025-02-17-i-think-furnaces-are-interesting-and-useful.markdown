I don’t know why you have to be such a downer, furnaces are my expertise. It is what I am studying at university to understand and have worked on for my whole career. I am one of just a handful of experts that understand the leading types of furnaces created, fuels used to operate them, as well as the automation that keeps the turning on and off, as well as at the right temperature. You telling me that I shouldn’t be doing my life’s work is just narrow minded and would end my career as I know it today. Why would you do that to me?

There is an unprecedented opportunity right now to push forward furnace materials, fuels, as well as automation by scaling the usage of furnaces. The company I work for is just looking to advance the technology, while also still producing a healthy revenue. The furnace industry has never seen such an opportunity to move forward our discipline at scale. It isn’t just my company, there are at least 25-50 competitors in the space and if we don’t take the government money to do this advanced work, one of our competitors will, so it might as well just be a good company like ours.

You know there are good uses of furnaces out there. How do you think your building stays warm on cold days? If you are against furnaces you are the one doing a lot of harm in the world. Think of all the people who will freeze to death if we aren’t doing furnace research and development. I just don’t understand how you can be so callous and ignorant of what the impacts of your beliefs will be. I can’t be held responsible for what everyone does with my furnace technology, and my family depends on the income from this work to scale and apply furnace technology.

Furnaces keep us warm, incinerate garbage, and do all kinds of amazing things. You can’t blame me for how a few bad apples might be using furnaces, and your overactive imagination about how they can be used is a little troubling at the least. I just can’t imagine a world without furnaces, even with some of the unsanctioned ways they get used. I strongly believe that my scaling and automation software can be used to identify these bad apples and will actually allow us to ensure our technology is only used for good. You are standing in the way of this work, and this future, could you please end your protest so I can continue my work.
