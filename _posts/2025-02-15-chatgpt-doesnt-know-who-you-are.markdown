You are lucky that ChatGPT even knows you are! When you ask who I am it doesn’t know, and I am unable to even get a job as good as yours. So quit your whining. You know that the process to correct ChatGPT’s description of you will take months, if not years, or maybe never. You are just better off performing as it expects to keep you within view of your business leadership. You will have better results if you just play the game and don’t try to challenge things.

Is it really that bad that ChatGPT describes you as having done things that you haven’t done, or would it be worse to have it shift outside the definition of your current enterprise role? At least the hallucination doesn’t jeopardize your job. You are just going to have to chop off a couple of your sleep hours to engage on social media and make some videos that improve your profile and show to the algorithm that you are on the right track. The hallucinations are just signals that the algorithm is having to stretch to keep you fitting with what it knows about you.

If you kick me down some food and give me a place to crash, I’ll come by in the evening and use your computer to create some content, and play some of the games for you. You can just kick back and rest. I just need a warm meal and a place to sleep when I am done. I would do it for you while you are at work, but you will need your computer. We have a similar size and build, plus I’ve read your work for years, and know how you write and speak. I can mimic you quite well. We can do it for two weeks and if you don’t see any change in how ChatGPT describes you we can try it your way, but I am telling you we can perform the way you need and it will take less time and headache.

I get that you don’t want to do the work and you feel like this isn’t who you are, but trust me, the alternative is not as rosy as you think. I can’t get the types of jobs you do. I can’t get a hotel room in your average hotel. If I get detained by the police it could be days or weeks before I get let out. ChatGPT knowing you are is a good thing, even if it isn’t always accurate. I’d trade places with you in heartbeat, so why do we just work together to keep you operating at the level you are at. Without it we are both screwed, and I don’t think we have any other alternatives without family support.
