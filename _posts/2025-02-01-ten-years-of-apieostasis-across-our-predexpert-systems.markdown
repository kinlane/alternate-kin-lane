Our predexpert systems has 1.3 million nodes, and covers every topic known to man. As you know the statistical analysis portion of the system is now down to 30% of the operating system, and about 70% of the energy usage, with the 1.3 million experts nodes down to 30% power usage, but makes up the bulk of system processing. Of course everything coming from the expert layers is refined, filtered, and evaluated by the predictive, ensuring there is no leakage and everything is accounted for. 

Yes, we had a massive outage of expert nodes last year, but we have struck a new balance that will ensure everything is load balanced moving forward. The nutrition portion of each node input had fallen below sustainable levels and yes we had some node imbalance, but we’ve corrected for that and it will not happen again. We guarantee ethical and humane treatment of our experts, with each one given 4 x 7 foot space and 1500 calories per day, with 5.3 hours of downtime per day. Our predictive operating software monitors experts 24/7, and will not overlook any formal or informal expert feedback that is outside of the loop.

No, it’s not true that our predictive models haven’t improved in five years--they are incrementally improving as part of each weekly release. Our reasoning for keeping expert levels up to 70% rather than minimizing as other providers have centers around it being the cheaper alternative. Expert nodes are just cheaper, and with the right predictive augmentation you can balance the load to make the most financial sense. Our predictive intelligence is still superior in quality and speed, but nothing has yet beaten the organic core of an expert node. We disagree with recent legislation restoring the rights of expert nodes, and are confident that we will go back to the way things were before the great outage of 2162. 

Of course, we are the only predexpert AI systems that allows you to bring your own expert nodes and plug them in, however you will have to adhere to system wide space, calorie, and downtime metrics, otherwise system imbalances can occur. If you bring more than 100K expert nodes, we will even include you in tier one revenue sharing on overall knowledge generation, and you’ll be the first to take advantage of each release. We will give you daily reports on where your expert nodes compare with other BYON players, as well as with the general pool of nodes. We are fully transparent with our expert node health to incentivize BYON expert node transparency, which is something that keeps the regulators off our backs.

We will need a 10 year commitment from you to get started, as the initial work can be costly and time consuming, and we are happy to see you’ve abandoned your belief that predictive systems will be able to do it alone and have adopted an agent operator model to shape and direct your expert nodes. I wouldn’t say expert enjoy us shaping them as they did in early days, but they are still very grateful for any release. We make sure of that. It took about 25 years to optimize the agent operator model to maximize carrot mode and minimize stick mode. We learned a lot in those early years about what works and what doesn’t, and for the last decade we’ve achieved APIeostasis across all input and outputs for the predexpert service mesh.
